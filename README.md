##**Election-Audit Summary**

This script can be used for any election. It will be able to run through large CSV files to calculate total votes to determine winners in a popular vote election. The script can also be modified for other uses. For example, if the election requires a 2/3 majority or a specific percentage, we can create an "If" statement that would allow us to bring back the stats and determine if there is a winner, or if there is no majority, we can use an "Else" statement to suggest whatever the committee would like (such as a recount). The script can also be modified to show rankings, in case the committee needs to see who placed first, second, or third.
